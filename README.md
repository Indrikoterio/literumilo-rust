# Literumilo - A spell checker and morphological analyzer for Esperanto, written in Rust.

Literumilo checks the spelling of Esperanto words, and divides them into morphemes.
For example, 'miskomprenita' is divided as 'mis.kompren.it.a'.

Literumilo can analyze individual Esperanto words, or an entire file of Esperanto text.
